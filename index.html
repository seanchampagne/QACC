      <h3>Recent Agenda and Activites</h3>
<h4>October 1, 2016</h4>
<h5>Focus:  Council Elections</h5>
<h6>Written: October 3, 2016 by Sean Champagne</h6>
<p>On September 21, 2016, QACC held elections for twelve positions
  on the community council.
  Incumbent council members that were re-elected:
  Michael Crow, Don Harper, Marty Kaplan, Robert Kettle, Margaret Okamoto,
  Jim Smith, and Mike Warren.  New council members include:
  Brittney Bollay, Sean Champagne, Laura Day, Michael Jerrett,
  and Catherine Wilson.  Congratulations to everyone and
  we will see everyone at our next meeting on October 5, 2016.

        <h4>September 7, 2016</h4>
        <h5>Focus: Bhy Kracke Park</h5>
        <h6>Written: September 27, 2016 by Sean Champagne</h6>
        <p>
          Katie Bang, capital project coordinator, from Seattle Parks and Recreation Department was the guest speaker
          and highlighted city renovations to Bhy Kracke Park to an approximate meeting of 45 people.  The focus of the discussion
          was on the necessary slope management the city will undertake to reinforce the
          hillside.  Including planning, designing, and construction the total budget is an estimated
          $261,000 with construction beginning Summer/Fall 2017.  The primary construction will
          specifically increase the width of the main pathway from 5' to 7', destruction and potential
          reconstruction of the park arbor covered in wysteria, construction of the new wall, and removal
          of a couple secondary and unsanctioned pathways.  Questions from the crowd highlighted
          a concern of the arbor, but the biggest concern from the crowd appeared to be lack of maintenance
          by the city officials.  A 30 year Queen Anne resident highlighted the last 8 years since the
          2008 financial crisis with deep budget cuts the city has shirked responsibility in park maintenance
          which has allowed invasive species such as Himilayan blackberry and morning glory to completely take
          over the park and kill off many of the origin vegetation that was maintained by the city.
